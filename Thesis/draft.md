## Introduction
Three-Dimensional Integrated Circuits (3D ICs) are emerging as a natural way to
overcome interconnect scaling problems in 2D ICs. Vertically stacked dies in 3D
ICs are connected via $ Cu $ Though Silicon Vias (TSV). 

Due to the dramatic variance of 
coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of $Cu$ and $SiO_2$ in the metal-silicon
connection of TSVs, wafers will encounter with lager thermal stress near TSVs.
